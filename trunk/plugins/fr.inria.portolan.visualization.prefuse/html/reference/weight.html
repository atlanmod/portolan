         Weight Visualization
      </h2>
      <p>
		You may display a quantitative value for each node using the weight
		mechanism.
	  </p>
      <h3>
      	Principle
      </h3>
      <p>
      	The quantitative value is represented by a shape which surface is
      	corresponding to the value (in respect to visual principles presented
      	by Jacques Bertin in <em>SÃ©miologie graphique</em>).
      </p>
      <h3>
      	Syntax
      </h3>
      <p>
      	As the size of nodes on the screen should be smaller than the screen,
      	you have to ensure that values passed to the viewer do not exceed
      	a top value fixed as the square value of the maximum width of shape
      	you want to appear on screen (10 pixels width implies 100 max value).
      </p>
      <p>
        The value for an Entity element has to be put in a metadata which key
        is <code>weight</code> and value is an integer (stored as a String).
      </p>
      <h3>
      	Effects
      </h3>
      <p>
      	The Portolan Visualization will dsiplay every node with a 
      	<code>weight</code> metadata with a shape which area will be the value
      	stored in the metadata. If the value is not valid (error in the String
      	to Integer reading), the node as no shape (the default behavior).
      </p>
