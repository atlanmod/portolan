         Discovery Task
      </h2>
      <p>
		The goal of this step is to transform diverse data from different sources,
		provided as-is by the final user (the <em>Cartography User</em> actor), into a
		central cartography model which conforms to the core metamodel (usually through
		an extension of it). All the tasks are handled by an engineer with skills in
		MDE, whose role is the <em>Cartography Designer</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
		The user's source data are taken as inputs of the discovery work. This work may
		be split in many parallel sub-processes to handle different kinds of data
		(distinct sources, specific formats, queries and computations). Each
		sub-process is composed of a translation chain relying on metamodels for both,
		data formats and cartography. This chain can be composed of a set of
		specialized injectors (doing text-to-model transformations like XML parsing)
		and model-to-model transformations, depending on the nature of data. The
		involved metamodels are usually domain-specific, related to formats to be
		supported. The target metamodel is the core cartography metamodel or the
		user-defined extension DSL which has been designed in previous step. The final
		result of the discovery process is the contents of the central cartography
		model.
