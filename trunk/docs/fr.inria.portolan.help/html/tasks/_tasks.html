      <h2>
         Cartography High Level Tasks
      </h2>
      <p>
		Our proposal to handle Cartography work lays in four higher order tasks (in red
		around the user cartography model in figure below) which
		can be understood as steps in the data-to-visualization process for a given domain:
			<ol>
			  <li><em>Metamodeling</em>: capture the domain concepts in a DSL which
				  consists in a metamodel extension inheriting from the cartography metamodel;
			  <li><em>Discovery</em>: inject user data into a central cartography model
				  which conforms to the domain extension of the cartography metamodel;
			  <li><em>View Definitions</em>: filter the central user cartography model to
				  get partial and/or computed views of it;
			  <li><em>Visualization</em>: obtain graphical displays of user's data by
				  running provided visualizations on the central user cartography model or its subsets.
			</ol>
      </p>
      <p>
		These four high level tasks of the process involve distinct actors (in green in
		figure below) that can be classified in three kinds:
			<ul>
			  <li><em>Cartography User</em>: he is the person the whole cartography is
				  designed for; he provides its <b>data</b> as input of the process and use
				  the corresponding <b>viewers</b> (to visualize them and take decisions from
				  that views); he does not need skills in MDE nor in Cartography
			  <li><em>Cartography Designer</em>: he is an engineer with enough skills in
				  MDE to be able to draw the <b>domain metamodel</b> extension, to
				  chain and use <b>discovery</b> tools (generating the user central
				  cartography model) and to write useful <b>view definitions</b>; he could
				  be an engineer of the user company or an external IT service provider;
			  <li><em>Visualization Provider</em>: it is an external company or organism,
				  which builds pluggable model transformations and <b>visualization</b> tools
				  relying on the cartography metamodel; the visualization may be provided as a
				  component-on-the-shelf.
			</ul>
