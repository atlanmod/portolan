      <p>
         A <em>View Definition</em> is a specialized model
         <a href="transformation.html">transformation</a>, which purpose is to
         filter the <a href="model.html">model</a> and produce a sub-set of it,
         relying on the same <a href="metamodel.html">metamodel</a>.
         This transformation can compute elements to create new ones 
         or change/add some values on existing ones, and remove those which
         have no interest in this view.
      </p>
      <p>
         View definitions in Portolan are associated with a specific
         <a href="../reference/extensions.html">extension point</a>. Users can
         add new views on their central model in order to
         <a href="visualization.html">visualize</a> sub-sets of it.
