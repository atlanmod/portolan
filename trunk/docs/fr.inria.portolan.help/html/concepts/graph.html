      <p>
         Portolan visualizations are underlined by graph concepts.
         The <em>PortolanCore</em> metamodel embeds elements which can be
         easily transformed in corresponding graph concepts, and then
         satisfying visualization needs:
		<ul>
		 <li> the view has to display a name for nodes => identify model
			 elements (<code>IdentifiedElement</code> type);
		 <li> geographical maps need to locate elements=> retrieve
			 contents from the corresponding node (<code>LocatedElement</code> type)
		 <li> graphs imply to visually rely elements together through edges
			 => explicit binding instances (<code>Relationship</code> type);
		 <li> some relations are one-way => directional binding instances
			 (<code>DirectedRelationship</code> type);
		 <li> there is interest for grouping / containment notion =>
			 items may be included in characterizations (<code>Group</code> and
			 <code>Container</code> types);
		 <li> each item may have related individual properties, giving ability to
			 filter on these properties => kind of a <em>type
			 object</em> mechanism (<code>Metadata</code> type).
		</ul>
