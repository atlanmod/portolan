         First Launch of Portolan
      </h2>
      <p>
         When you launch Portolan for the first time, its creates a
         <em>Portolan</em> directory in your user space. The Portolan
         framework opens on the <em>Visualization</em> perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
         The workspace is empty  so you get an error message if you try any
         of the visualization buttons on the View bar on the left.
      </p>
      <p>
         In order to have a better idea of Portolan features, you have to
         install the provided example. Go in Portolan <em>File</em> menu,
         and then select <em>New...</em>, click on <em>Portolan Tools
         Cartography Example</em>. Once it is done, you can use the View bar
         buttons and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
         Now, you may switch to the <em>Edition</em> or the <em>Discovery</em>
         perspectives and look at the structure and data of the example
         project.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are now ready to create your own <a href="newproject.html">Portolan
         project</a>.
