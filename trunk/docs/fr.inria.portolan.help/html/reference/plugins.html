         Extending Portolan with plug-ins
      </h2>
      <p>
         Every tool provider can enhance Portolan (or insert its tool into
         the Portolan application) by the mean of Eclipse plug-ins
         mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
         Such plug-ins can added behavior to Portolan by declaring appropriate
         extensions. In its current state of development, Portolan offers two
         extensions points which may be use to insert additional commands:
         <ul>
            <li>the builder extension point:
               <code>fr.inria.portolan.common.builder</code>. 
            <li>the editor (also named 'Full View') extension point:
               <code>fr.inria.portolan.visualization.fullView</code>. 
         </ul>
         See their dedicated page for more informations about their use and
         effects.
