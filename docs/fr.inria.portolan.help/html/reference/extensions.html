         Portolan Extension Points
      </h2>
      <p>
         The Portolan Model Cartography application can be extended using an
         extension mechanism based on the Eclipse extension points.
      </p>
      <p>
         The design of Portolan enables extensions from the users: it relies
         on the <a href="viewdefinitions.html">View Definitions</a>. See the
         corresponding page for additional information.
      </p>
      <p>
         Some Portolan extension points target additions to the application
         through plug-ins providing new visual functionnalities. The main
         graph visualization and the defaut Modisco model browser also
         use this mechanism to provide their features into Portolan. See
         the <a href="plugins.html">plug-ins</a> page and corresponding 
         <a href="extensions.html">extensions</a> page for more
         information.
      </p>
      <p>
         The >Portolan cartography framework includes a
         <a href="builders.html">build</a> mechanism which takes care about
         changes in the user project.
