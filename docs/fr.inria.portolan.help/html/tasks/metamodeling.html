         Metamodeling task
      </h2>
      <p>
		The metamodeling step is a work of specification of the user's domain over the
		cartography metamodel. Three cases are relevant:
			<ul>
			  <li>the Cartography core metamodel can be used as-is by customers, who
				  will then build the discovery tools and generate the central model using the
				  core types (see the first figure below);
			  <li>it may also be extended by an engineer (the <em>Cartography
				  Designer</em> role) to carry types closer to the user domain, these specific
				  types relying to the core ones by inheritance; in this case, the
				  metamodeling initial step consists in catching the concepts underlying the
				  user domain and drawing the corresponding metamodel extension over the
				  cartography core metamodel; each kind of element within the system under
				  study needs to be identified, giving the corresponding type; the resulting
				  types of the metamodel extension define a DSL which enables corresponding
				  tooling, transformations and modeling of the domain; such a DSL is visible in
				  second figure below;
			  <li>an existing metamodel of the domain could also be reused as soon as
				  inheritance to cartography core metamodel types is added to its types; we
				  have to remark that the relations between elements which were defined by
				  references need to be reified within explicit types in order to inherit from
				  (<code>Directed</code>)\<code>Relationship</code> core type;
			</ul>
