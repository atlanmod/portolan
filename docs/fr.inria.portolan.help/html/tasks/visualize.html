         Visualization Task
      </h2>
      <p>
		The visualizations stricto sensu are external components which are realized and
		brought to end-users by <em>Visualization Providers</em>. Each visualization
		relies on a specific viewer and a dedicated transformation chain. This chain
		implies Model-Driven Interoperability and embeds the metamodels corresponding to
		the formats needed by the viewer. We have used existing metamodels (like
		GraphML, from previous projects) and we defined these which were lacking (such
		as the KML one).
      </p>
      <p>
		Each chain takes the central cartography model conforming to the cartography
		metamodel as input, translates its contents into a model conforming to the DSL
		of the viewer format through a model-to-model transformation, and extracts the
		corresponding file in the textual format using a model-to-text extractor.
      </p>
      <p>
		The final output is opened by the viewer. The <em>Cartography User</em> can then
		manipulate the view in order to better understand and analyze it.
