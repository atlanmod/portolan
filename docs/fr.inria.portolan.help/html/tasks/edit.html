         Edition Task
      </h2>
      <p>
		The Edition task mainly concerns the creation and modification of
		<a href="../concepts/viewdefinition.html">View Definitions</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
		View Definitions are transformations of the central cartography model 
		conforming to the core metamodel and its possible user-domain extension. They
		are written by the <em>Cartography Designer</em>. When they are applied to the
		central model, the result is a subset of it that also conforms to the
		cartography metamodel. This subset of the central model can then be processed
		as the original one by the provided visualizations.
