         Portolan Model Cartography
      </h1>
      <p>
         The Portolan is dedicated to models viewing and handling. It relies
         mainly on Model-Driven Engineering to offer abilities to explore data,
         detect underlying structures and search for potential problems or
         solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Portolan architecture has been design to make easier additions of
         features in both a user way and a tool provider approach. Users can
         extend viewing capacities by writing View Definitions which filter
         models, giving more specific view on part of their data models.
         External Eclipse tool providers can insert their own viewers and add
         corresponding behavior to Portolan, with benefits for end-users.
