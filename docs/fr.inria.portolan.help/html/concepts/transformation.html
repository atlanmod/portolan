         Model Transformation
      </h2>
      <p>
         In Model-Driven Engineering, every model can be transformed in another
         <a href="model.html">model</a>, relying on their respective 
         <a href="metamodel.html">metamodels</a>. This can be done by
         languages dedicated to such work, like the 
         <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/atl/">ATL</a> declarative language
         provided by Portolan framework.
      </p>
      <p>
         Each transformation is considered as a model of the upper level,
         conforming to its own language metamodel (some <em>Higher Order
         Transformations</em> can be designed to modify or generate such
         transformations).
